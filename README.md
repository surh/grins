## Guidelines

What follows is a list of general guidelines suggested by Sur.
Feel free to add to it or discuss any of them by raising
[issues](https://github.com/surh/grins/issues)

1. Commit as often as possible.
2. Include a descriptive message on each commit
3. When merging, use the `--no-ff` (no feed forward) option.
4. We will use a directory structure in which each directory
should contain self contained code.
5. Whenever adding a directory, modify this README to include
a brief description of what is in that directory.
6. Any new directory must contain its own README file.
7. All scripts must have usage documentation. Use whatever
tools are optimal for the specific language.
